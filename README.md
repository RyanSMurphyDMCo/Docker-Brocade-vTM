# Docker-Brocde-vTM

Brocade vTM (Formerly Riverbed SteelApp / Stingray )
====================================================

This is a container for the Brocade Virtual Traffic Manager. 

<http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/application-delivery-controllers.html>

<http://www.brocade.com/en/products-services/application-delivery-controllers/virtual-traffic-manager.html>

This container is supplied without a license key and will run in developer mode out of the box. You can run with: 

    $ docker run -e ZEUS_EULA=accept --privileged -t -d tuxinvader/brocade-vtm

You must set *ZEUS_EULA*=accept to indicate that you accept the license agreement, otherwise the software will not start. You may also specify a License file to download over HTTP using *ZEUS_LIC*, and a password using *ZEUS_PASS*. Eg:

    $ docker run -e ZEUS_EULA=accept -e ZEUS_LIC=http://10.1.1.1/fla.lic -e ZEUS_PASS=t3llNo0n3 --privileged -t -d tuxinvader/brocade-vtm

If you don't specify a ZEUS_PASS or you set ZEUS_PASS=RANDOM or ZEUS_PASS=SIMPLE, then a password will be randomly generated for you. The password will be made up from alphanumerics and (,) comma, (.) period, (-) hyphen, (_) underscore, and (+) plus. The password will be printed to the console after start up.

You can also set ZEUS_PASS=STRONG if you want to generate a stronger password making use of more symbols.

Additional Environment Variables
--------------------------------

*ZEUS_DOM*

This allows you to use the autogenerated hostname set by docker, and set the domain part of the FQDN from this variable. However the run script can not currently update /etc/hosts, so you must ensure that the FQDN is resolvable by the container in DNS. Using -h to set the hostname yourself might be a better option. 

*ZEUS_PACKAGES*

You may also set a space seperated list of packages in the ZEUS_PACKAGES variable to get them installed on the first run of the container.
This is useful if you want to enable Java Extensions. Eg:

    $ docker run -e ZEUS_EULA=accept -e ZEUS_PACKAGES="openjdk-7-jre-headless" --privileged -t -d tuxinvader/brocade-vtm

*ZEUS_DEVMODE*

If you do not provide a license and the vTM starts up in developer mode then you will need to accept the developer mode warning on first login. 
You may pass ZEUS_DEVMODE=yes in order to avoid seeing that warning.

*ZEUS_CLUSTER_NAME*

If you want this vtm to join an existing cluster, simply provide the DNS name of one of the cluster member through this environment variable.

Usage with Brocade Service Director (Formerly SSC)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Self Registration
Since vTM 10.4 and Service Director 2.4.0 is has been possible for vTMs to AutoRegister themselves with the Services Director. 

In order for vTM to register itself with a Services Director, you can provide the following additional environment parameters to the container:

*ZEUS_REGISTER_HOST*
The Host/IP and Port of your Services Directors REST API. Eg: sd.mycompany.com:8100

*ZEUS_REGISTER_FP*
The SHA-1 fingerprint of the Service Directors REST API

You can also optionally provide an email (*ZEUS_REGISTER_EMAIL*) and message (*ZEUS_REGISTER_MSG*)

## Auto Approval
Since 17.1(?) and BSD 2.6 you can have the licenses auto-accepted according to a policy. To do so provide the additional parameters:

*ZEUS_REGISTER_POLICY*
The policy_id of the auto-approval policy to use for this vTM

*ZEUS_REGISTER_OWNER*
The name of the Owner for this vTM

*ZEUS_REGISTER_SECRET*
If the Owner has a secret, then you need to provide that secret here.

Example:

    $ docker run -e ZEUS_EULA=accept -e ZEUS_REGISTER_HOST=sd1:8100 -e ZEUS_REGISTER_FP="A0:A1:A2:A3:A4:A5:A6:A7:A8:A9:B1:B2:B3:B4:B5:B6:B7:B8:B9:B0" -e ZEUS_REGISTER_EMAIL=me@somewhere.com -e ZEUS_REGISTER_MSG="Hell Yeah" -e ZEUS_REGISTER_OWNER=Mark -e ZEUS_REGISTER_OWNER_SECRET=qwerty1 -e ZEUS_REGISTER_POLICY=Policy-9999-9999-9999-9999 --privileged -t -d tuxinvader/brocade-vtm

Legacy Usage with Brocade Service Director (Formerly SSC)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The docker instance needs a FQDN in order for the SSC to license it. You can either provide the container a fully qualified name at launch using -h, or you can specify the domain in an environment variable called ZEUS_DOM. 

    $ docker run -e ZEUS_EULA=accept -e ZEUS_LIC=http://10.1.1.1/fla.lic -e ZEUS_PASS=t3llNo0n3 -e ZEUS_DOM=demo.local --privileged -t -d tuxinvader/brocade-vtm

#

Accessing the Instance
-------------------------------

Once started, point your web browser at port 9090 to access the web interface, or your rest client at port 9070.

#

Building a docker image from github REPO
----------------------------------------
